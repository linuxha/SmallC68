# SmallC68XX - Small C for the Motorola 68XX family under Linux 

Ron Cain's 1.1 Small C compiler for the 6800, 6801, 6803 and 6809. Maybe the 68HC11.

Originally these were Flex OS Compilers but I'm not certain if they're for the 6800 or 6809 versions of Flex. My intention is to set them up to work on Linux as a cross-compiler.

# Notes

After reading and poking around the Flex Small C Compiler DSK images I've guessed that these are Ron Cain's Small C V1.1 compiler and that the runXX (00,01,09) are the runtime files that take the psuedo code and make it understandable (assemble) under Flex.

The ccx.c files is the smallc.c file broken into 9 sections so the small C compiler can compile itself on Flex. Since I'll be using Linux to cros compile. I'll not include this files.

```
cc0.c
cc1.c
cc2.c
cc3.c
cc4.c
cc5.c
cc6.c
cc7.c
cc8.c
```

The important file is smallc.c, that's my starting point. The p.c file is a C pre-processor. I'm not sure if I'll use it but decided to keep it here for now. The rest of the files are files needed to assemble the psuedo code generated by the small C compiler. At this time I'm not sure which is which. I'll work on that.

For the moment I've selected LGPL 2.1, I'm not certain I can do this as the previous programmers had different licenses.

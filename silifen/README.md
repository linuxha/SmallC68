# Silicon Fen Software Small C for V2.1 the Motorola 68XX Processor

I'm busy reading the Small-C Handbook by James E. Hendrix and from what I can tell this version by "Silicon Fen Software: Small-C Compiler R1.1.0 4/7/85". Despite the r1.1 it support the the for loop which is part of James E. Hendrix v2.1. At the moment I'm having to fix the char */int usage because 64 bit linux char pointers occupy the same size as a lone (8 bytes) and the same size as int (4 bytes). For those not familiar with the various CPUs, porting C and address size. The 8 bit machines typically had 16bit char pointers and ints. But as we moved to 16/32/64 bit machines the size of the char * matched the machine address width. Hense 64 bits wide on 64 bits Linux/Windows. This is also what we now have stdint.h and the unit8_t, uint16_t, ... etc. This helps avoid some of the confusing.

              Notes for use of CRASMB with SFS small-C R1.1b
              ----------------------------------------------

For 6809 use to generate a FLEX command.

Make sure that LIBDEF09.TXT has CRASMB set 1 in it.

+++exec goto9

+++cc sieve.c -o sieve.m -d             normal useage

+++opt sieve.m sieve.om                 normal useage

+++crasmb sieve.om,sieve.cmd,i6809+ls

+++sieve


See Manual Appendix B for details of 6801 code generation, this
appendix does not cover CRASMB use, it assumes Compusense XASM6801.

To generate 6801 code but assemble into 6809 FLEX command for testing.

Make sure that LIBDEF91.TXT has CRASMB set 1 in it.

+++exec goto91

If sieve.om is still around from 6809 use then it can be used,
otherwise make it as above.

+++cc sieve.c -o sieve.m -d             no difference from 6809

+++opt sieve.om sieve.cmd               no difference from 6809

+++crasmb sieve.om,sieve91.cmd,i6809+ls

+++sieve91

The above version of sieve, sieve91, uses 6801 assembly language
definitions of the macro's used to generate code but the 6809
assembler turns these into a subset of the 6809 instruction set.
The code is larger and slower than pure 6809 and is a bit larger
and slower than it would be on a real 6801.

To generate code for a 6801/6811/6301

Make sure that LIBDEF01.TXT has CRASMB set 1 in it.

Check that LIBM01.TXT has the processor type set up. One of
M6801, M6811 or H6301 should be SET 1.

Check that LIBF01.TXT has the correct memory map set up using
CCODE, CDATA and CSTACK for the target system.

The program starts at the label START in LIBC01.TXT, this needs
to be jumped to in some way on the target system. To set up the
reset vector the CSEG macro in LIBM01.TXT could be changed to:

CSEG macro
     org $FFFE
     fdb START
     org CCODE
     endm

Terminal I/O primitives need to be put into LIBH.TXT
if any character based I/O is required. Any other hardware
access routines can be placed in LIBH.TXT. A C header file
is provided, HARDWARE.H and this should be #included or
compiled in with the program otherwise LIBH.TXT will not
be loaded in by the assembler. Alternatively LIBLOAD1.TXT could
be modified to always load LIBH.TXT.

Finally -

+++exec goto1

If the .om file is note left over from above then recompile,
there is no change as far as the compiler is concerned for 6801.

+++cc sieve.c -o sieve.m -d             normal compile

+++opt sieve.m sieve.om                 normal opt

+++crasmb sieve.om,sieve1.bin,i6801+ls  (or use i6811,i6301 as required)

Then get sieve1.bin into the target processor in the same way you would
for an assembler program that used crasmb.
```

# Status

Currently in the process of being modernized. When done this will be a cross compiler under Linux/Windows. You won't be able to compile this under Flex. And if done correctly you should be able to use it with Motorola 68XX embedded boards with no OS.
